DEBUG=true npm run test:all

# Run specific test with verbose output
npm run test:comprehensive -- --verbose
```

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues not covered in this guide:

1. Check the console output for detailed error messages
2. Review the test results for specific failure reasons
3. Check the database connection and API endpoints
4. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
5. Ensure all dependencies are installed

## 🔄 Continuous Testing

### Automated Testing
Set up CI/CD to run tests automatically:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run test:all
```

### Regular Testing Schedule
- Run `npm run test:all` before each deployment
- Run `npm run test:comprehensive` after database changes
- Run `npm run test:frontend` after UI changes
- Run `npm run test:404` after adding new pages
