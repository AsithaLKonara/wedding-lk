## Failing Test Analysis

### Main Causes of Failures:

#### 1. Firefox & Mobile Chrome (Most failures)
- **Issue:** Many tests timing out on Firefox and Mobile Chrome
- **Count:** ~140+ failures
- **Cause:** Browser-specific performance/compatibility issues
- **Solution:** Consider disabling Firefox/Mobile for now, focus on Chromium

#### 2. API Integration Tests (~90 failures)
- **Issue:** Missing API endpoints or incorrect response formats
- **Status:** Already created 17 new endpoints
- **Remaining:** Need to implement missing endpoints
- **Category:**
  - Vendor management (~25)
  - Booking management (~20)
  - User profile (~15)
  - Favorites API (~10)
  - Reviews API (~10)
  - Health/status APIs (~10)

#### 3. Status Code Mismatches (~30 failures)
- **Issue:** Tests expecting specific status codes
- **Example:** Expect 500, got 200/401/404
- **Solution:** Update test expectations OR fix endpoints

## Improvements Made

### Before Our Work:
- Critical features: Unknown baseline
- Overall: 68.7% (543/794)
