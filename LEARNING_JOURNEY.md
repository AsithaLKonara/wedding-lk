## ðŸ’­ Reflections

This project has been the most challenging and rewarding experience of my academic career. I started with basic knowledge and ended up building a comprehensive web application. The learning curve was steep, but every challenge taught me something valuable.

The most important lesson I learned is that software development is not just about writing code - it's about solving problems, working with others, and continuously learning. I also learned that it's okay to struggle and ask for help when needed.

I'm proud of what I've accomplished and excited to continue learning and growing as a developer.
