# ðŸ¤– WeddingLK Custom LLM Implementation Plan

## ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic plan for developing a custom Large Language Model (LLM) specifically tailored for WeddingLK's wedding planning platform. The custom LLM will provide domain-specific intelligence, cultural expertise, and cost-effective AI capabilities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Domain Expertise**: Provide Sri Lankan wedding planning intelligence
2. **Cost Optimization**: Reduce dependency on external AI APIs
3. **Competitive Advantage**: Offer unique, culturally-aware recommendations
4. **User Experience**: Deliver personalized, context-aware assistance

### Success Metrics
- 40% reduction in AI operational costs within 12 months
- 25% improvement in user satisfaction scores
- 60% increase in successful vendor matches
- 35% improvement in budget optimization accuracy

## ðŸ“Š Current State Analysis

### Existing AI Implementation
- **Base Model**: OpenAI GPT-4 with fallback mechanisms
- **Features**: Sentiment analysis, content generation, basic recommendations
- **Limitations**: Generic responses, no local expertise, high API costs
- **Usage**: ~1,000 queries/day, $500-800/month in API costs

### Data Assets Available
