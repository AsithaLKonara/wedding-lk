## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: Token Missing from Deployed Version
- **Local:** Token is in response ✅
- **Deployed:** Token NOT in response ❌
- **Status:** Deployment hasn't caught up with latest commits
- **Fix:** Wait for deployment OR verify which commit is deployed

### Issue #2: Timeout Errors
- Tests timing out on dashboard navigation
- Login successful but not navigating to dashboard
- Possible issues:
  - Auth token not being sent with requests
  - Dashboard page not loading correctly
  - Middleware redirect loops

## Current Deployment Status

- **API Response:** Missing token field
- **Database:** Connected and working ✅
- **Test Users:** Seeded successfully ✅

## What's Working

1. ✅ Authentication API is responding
2. ✅ Database connection is healthy
3. ✅ Test users are seeded
4. ✅ Some tests are passing
5. ✅ Homepage, login page, registration loading
6. ✅ Search functionality working

## What's Broken

1. ❌ Token not in signin response (deployment issue)
2. ❌ Dashboard navigation timeouts

## Next Actions

### Immediate (10 minutes):
1. Check Vercel deployment status
2. Verify which commit is currently deployed
3. Wait for latest deployment if needed
4. Re-run tests after deployment

### Short-term (30 minutes):
1. If deployment issues persist, check:
   - Vercel build logs
   - Environment variables
   - Edge runtime compatibility
2. Fix any remaining auth flow issues
3. Re-run test suite

### Medium-term (1-2 hours):
1. Address any discovered issues
2. Run full test suite
3. Achieve 100% on critical features
4. Document final results

## Estimated Time to 100%

- **If deployment is issue:** 10-15 minutes
- **If auth flow issue:** 30-45 minutes  
- **If both issues:** 45-60 minutes
- **Best case:** Already at 100% after deployment

## Current Recommendation

1. Check Vercel for deployment status
2. Verify latest commit is deployed
3. If not, wait for deployment OR trigger manually
4. Re-run tests to see if token is now included
5. Fix any remaining issues
6. Achieve 100% pass rate
